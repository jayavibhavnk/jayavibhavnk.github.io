👨🏻‍💻 I'm a final year Undergraduate student at the New Horizon College of Engineering.

🔬 My research interests are Generative AI and Natural Language Processing.

## Experience

Currently working part-time as an AI Intern at [Sparkflows](https://sparkflows.io). Working on the generative AI platform, developing methods for efficient integration of LLMs into various products and businesses.

## Selected Projects

- **Tl;DWR** - A mulitlingual browser extension which can summarise YouTube videos, playlists, websites, and more. Try it out at [Tl:DWR](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/tldwr/ddildclhomjgjkggmjjdaboebkmoogbn).
- **Blogify.ai** - A blog sharing platform powered by generative AI. Try it out at [Blogify](https://blogify-ai.netlify.app/), for LLM powered blog generator try out [blogify-LLM](https://blogify.streamlit.app/).
- **Brainzy** - Mindmaps and notes generator, [Brainzy](https://brainzy.streamlit.app/)
