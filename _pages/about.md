üë®üèª‚Äçüíª I'm a Master's Student at University of Southern California (Computer Science - AI)

üî¨ My research interests are Generative AI and Natural Language Processing.

## Experience

Previosuly working as full-time AI Intern at [Sparkflows](https://sparkflows.io). Working on the generative AI platform, developed methods for efficient integration of LLMs into various products and businesses.

## My Open-Soure Libraries

- [GraphRetrieval](https://pypi.org/project/GraphRetrieval/)
- [Multimodal GraphRetrieval](https://pypi.org/project/MultimodalGraphRetrieval/)

## Selected Projects

- **GRAEL** - Graph Retrieval and Augmentation for Education and Learning, A platform which has 10+ tools to simply learning using generative AI and custom graph retrieval library. [GRAEL](https://grael.netlify.app/)
- **Tl;DWR** - A mulitlingual browser extension which can summarise YouTube videos, playlists, websites, and more. Try it out at [Tl:DWR](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/tldwr/ddildclhomjgjkggmjjdaboebkmoogbn).
- **Blogify.ai** - A blog sharing platform powered by generative AI. Try it out at [Blogify](https://blogify-ai.netlify.app/), for LLM powered blog generator try out [blogify-LLM](https://blogify.streamlit.app/).
- **Brainzy** - Mindmaps and notes generator, [Brainzy](https://brainzy.streamlit.app/)
